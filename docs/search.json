    "text": "What is the point of this?\nIn medicine, we collect data from patients (Hx, Ex, Ix) to make meaningful conclusions (Dx, Mx). Data analysis tools like Deep Learning have shown success (CXR, sepsis ICU?) and failure (EPIC & sepsis) in helping us derive meaningful conclusions better.\nIt’s my belief that clinicians should be equipped with the basic knowledge of how it works, its benefits and limitations, so we can safely and confidently use it in our clinical practice. This website is a resource to do just that - to bridge clinical practice and emerging diagnostic tools. Often, clinicians encounter new papers in journals that outline groundbreaking discoveries regarding the application of deep learning in their field. However, due to the limitations of academic papers, they often fail to provide intuitive explanations of fundamental concepts such as what a neural network is. On the other hand, technical papers are far too unapproachable. In this website, I break down influential papers in each field and show you exactly what is going on behind the scenes.\n\n\n\nalt text"

    "text": "Introduction\n\nIn this review, we break down the exact model that Gargeya & Leng use in their paper “Automated Identification of Diabetic Retinopathy Using Deep Learning”.\nThe Overview and Key Takeaways sections are written for clinicians, the Technical Overview section is written for clinicians who want more detail on the nitty gritty (and we show you how easy it is to train a model yourself!).\n\nAs always, it is not expected for you to know anything about Deep Learning and jargon is explained where appropriate.\n\n\n\nOverview\nIn identifying diabetic retinopathy (DR), we traditionally interpret the retinal fundus, looking for characteristics like microaneurysms, neovascularisation and hard exudates [@eyewiki] (eyewiki.aao.org/Diabetic Retinopathy).\nBroadly speaking, we’re turning data (the fundal image) into data (a number saying if DR is present or not). The fundal image is itself made out of pixels, which are numbers. There are 3 ‘channels’ of Red, Blue and Green that compose a colour image. Here’s what a fundus looks like:  Note how the Red channel is brighter. This means it scores a higher value - it is more red than it is green or blue which is to be expected!\nFor simplicity’s sake, let’s assume there is just 1 channel.\n\nturning our data into numbers (pixels to numbers), let’s keep in mind our end product: it is a probability of our fundus having DR or not - it is a number\nessentially we use basic math like addition and multiplication to turn all these numbers into a final number, which is our probability.\nmultiplying and adding up our data by random numbers (x) ⇒ called a convolution\n\ngif of convolutions shrinking data\ndo you see how now our matrix shrinks all the way down to 1 number\n\nnow we have our data, our convolutions and one number at the end\n\nnow we know what answer we want, now we can change our random kernel numbers to what will get us our answer!\nit’s sorta like looking at the answer sheet and changing our working out to get to the final answer\nusing basic calculus, we can figure out if each random number in each kernel needs to increase or decrease to get closer to the actual answer\n\nthe metric we call that we optimise for is the ‘loss function’\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Takeaways\n\n\nTechnical Overview\n# Fixing our Data\n# Transforming our Data\n# Ending with Probabilities\n# Getting the Answer",
